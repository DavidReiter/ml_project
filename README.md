# Instrument recognition in musical audio signals

This project focuses on instrumental recognition in musical audio signals. The basic plan is to create a machine learning algorithm that identifies a certain group of instruments. 
This will be implemented using the IRMAS Dataset to learn and test the model.

## TODOs

- [ ] refactor code
- [ ] documentation
- [x] models
  - [x] random forest (normal + pca) -> explain feature selection
  - [x] neural network (normal)
  - [x] neural network pca
- [x] spectrum as feature
- [x] apply PCA with more variance
- [x] more hyperparameters
- [x] limit outliers instead of removing them
- [ ] explain why 20 mfcc
- [ ] outcomment everything regarding NN and run it (tensorflow not working on m1 chip) 
- [ ] include NN in decision
- [ ] final decision for a model + explanation
- [ ] formatting for pdf
